[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/fda-toolkit.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/fda-toolkit/)

An enterprise-grade Python toolkit designed for financial analysts, accountants, and data professionals who need reliable, auditable, and repeatable analytics.
FDA Toolkit delivers 67+ production-ready functions for financial data cleaning, validation, profiling, and pipeline automation, helping teams replace fragile spreadsheets with controlled, scalable workflows.

**Install:** 
```bash
pip install fda-toolkit
```

**Why FDA Toolkit Matters:**  
Most finance teams struggle with inconsistent data, manual checks, and reporting processes that do not scale. FDA Toolkit reflects how I approach financial analytics in practice: build once, reuse safely, and trust the output.
The toolkit embeds financial controls, validation logic, and traceability directly into the analytics layer, ensuring results remain dependable as data volume and complexity grow.

**Key Features:**
- **67 production-ready functions** across 8 intelligent modules
- **Full type hints** with IDE autocomplete throughout
- **Compliance-ready** with automatic audit logging & traceability
- **Finance-aware validation** for real-world workflows
- **One-line pipelines** for complex transformations (e.g., `ftk.quick_clean_finance()`)
- **Enterprise quality** — error handling, security, memory optimization
