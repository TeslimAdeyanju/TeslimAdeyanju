# 👋 Hi, I'm Teslim

### Chartered Accountant using Python, SQL, Power BI, and Advanced Excel to automate financial reporting and deliver audit ready analytics.

I build controlled, repeatable analytics systems that help finance teams move beyond static reporting and make confident, insight-driven decisions with clean data and strong governance.
